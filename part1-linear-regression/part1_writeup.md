# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
    r squared is a value between zero and one that predicts the accuracy of the model. a value closer to one means the model ismore accurate and a value closer to zero means it is less accurate.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
137
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think that the predictions are not very accurate as going off of age isnt the best indicator. This model is probably not accurate enough to predict based off of their age. You could improve this model by adding more factors.
